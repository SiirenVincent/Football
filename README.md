# KNN classifier and Naive Bayes classifier

# Introduction
In this repo you will find work of two algorithm with different data. KNN algorithm was used to predict people who were likely to survive during titanic incident. In this project we used titanic data.
Next algorithm used is Naive Bayes algorithm which predict if an email is a spam or not.

# Objective
Use KNN algorithm was used to predict people who were likely to survive titanic incident. Use the test data to predict the outcomes. 
Use Naive Bayes algorithm to predict whether an email is a spam or not.

In this project we use

- KNN-classifier

- Naive-Bayes-classifier
